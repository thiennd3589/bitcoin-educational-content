answer: Through the use of a blockchain based on Proof of Work with a floating difficulty.
wrong_answers:
  - Through the use of digital signatures.
  - Through the use of a public ledger.
  - Through the use of a Proof of Stake algorithm.
explanation: >-
  The Byzantine Generals' Problem is a classic problem in
distributed computing, which involves achieving consensus
in a network where some of the nodes may be faulty or
malicious. Bitcoin solves this problem through the use of a
blockchain based on Proof of Work, which ensures that all
nodes agree on the state of the transaction history.
