wrong_answers:
  - An agent gains control over more than half of the bitcoins in circulation.
  - An agent gains control over more than half of the nodes in the Bitcoin network.
  - An agent gains control over more than half of the mining pools in the Bitcoin
    network.
explanation: |
  In a 51% attack, an agent with more than half of the
  network hashrate could potentially manipulate the
  blockchain by creating an alternative chain of blocks.
  However, such an attack would be extremely costly and
  unlikely to be profitable, making it an unlikely scenario.
