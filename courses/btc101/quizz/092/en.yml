question: What is the recommended use of a multisig wallet?
answer: Storing large amounts for corporate use.
wrong_answers:
  - Storing small amounts for personal use.
  - Storing medium amounts for non-profit use.
  - Storing daily expenses for individual use.
explanation: |
  A multisig wallet is recommended for storing large amounts
  and for corporate usage because it requires multiple
  signatures to perform a transaction. This process adds an
  extra layer of security, because a single person cannot
  conduct a transaction without the approval of others.
