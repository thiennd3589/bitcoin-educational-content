wrong_answers:
  - Having access to enough individual private keys or backup components.
  - Sharing your private keys with other parties.
  - Sharing your public keys with other parties.
explanation: |
  When you use a multisig wallet, each private key of the
  multisig should be stored in different locations. This is
  because the multisig requires multiple signatures to carry
  out a transaction, so a certain number of wallets are
  needed. Thus, storing each part in a different location
  adds an extra layer of security.
