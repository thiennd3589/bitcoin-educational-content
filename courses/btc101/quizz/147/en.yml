question: What would be the implications for Bitcoin users if the blocks were 100 times heavier?
answer: Running a Bitcoin node would not be accessible to the average person, compromising the decentralization of the protocol and the immutability of both transactions and consensus rules.
wrong_answers:
  - Running a Bitcoin node would be more accessible to the average person, enhancing the decentralization of the protocol and the immutability of both transactions and consensus rules.
  - The transaction capacity of the network would decrease.
  - The block reward for miners would increase.
explanation: |
  If the blocks were 100 times heavier, running a Bitcoin
  node would require a 50TB hard disk, a bandwidth of over
  500GB/month, and hardware capable of validating hundreds of
  thousands of transactions in less than 10 minutes. This
  would make running a Bitcoin node inaccessible to the
  average person, compromising the decentralization of the
  protocol and the immutability of transactions and consensus
  rules.
