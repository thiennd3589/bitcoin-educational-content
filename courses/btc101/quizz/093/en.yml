question: What do you need to backup when using a wallet with a passphrase?
answer: You need to backup both the list of 12 or 24 words and your passphrase.
wrong_answers:
  - You need to only backup the list of 12 or 24 words.
  - You need to only backup your passphrase.
  - You need to neither backup the list of 12 or 24 words nor your passphrase.
explanation: |
  When you use a wallet with a passphrase, you need to backup
  both the list of 12 or 24 words and your passphrase,
  because the list of words and the passphrase are both
  necessary for regaining access to your funds in case of
  loss of your phone or computer. Without one or the other,
  the funds are non-accessible.
