question: What is the significance of energy expenditure in Bitcoin mining?
answer: The energy expenditure is necessary to produce the information, but the verification of information has a negligible cost. This asymmetry guarantees the security of the network.
wrong_answers:
  - The energy cost is necessary to power the ASIC machines used in mining, and the verification of information has a high costs.
  - The energy energy expenditure is necessary to maintain the Bitcoin network, and the verification of information has variable costs.
  - The energy energy cost is not necessary to create new bitcoins.
explanation: >-
  The energy cost in Bitcoin mining is a crucial aspect of the network's
  security. The high energy cost of mining makes it extremely expensive for a malicious
  actor to manipulate the blockchain, while the low cost of verifying transactions
  ensures that anyone can participate in the network.
