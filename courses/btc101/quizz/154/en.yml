question: What is the role of ASICs in Bitcoin mining?
answer: ASICs are machines designed solely for applying the SHA256 algorithm in the mining process.
wrong_answers:
  - ASICs are used to verify Bitcoin transactions by applying the SHA256 algorithm in the verification process.
  - ASICs are used to arbitrarily create new bitcoins.
  - ASICs are used to secure the Bitcoin network.
explanation: |
  ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) are
  specialized hardware designed specifically for Bitcoin
  mining. They are optimized to perform the SHA256 hashing
  function, which is the mathematical problem that miners
  must solve in the Proof of Work process.
