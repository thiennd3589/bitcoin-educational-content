question: How does Kerckhoff's principle facilitate the security of open systems like Linux?
answer: It allows for the public verification of potential vulnerabilities
wrong_answers:
  - It makes encryption algorithms invisible
  - It limits the number of potential users
  - It ensures the use of unique keys
explanation: |
  Kerckhoff's principle enables public verification of security flaws, as in open-source systems, which makes the systems more reliable through transparency. Security is ensured solely by the key, not by the encryption process itself.
