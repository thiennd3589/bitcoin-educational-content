question: What is the main type of algebraic structure used in finite fields for cryptography?
answer: Irreducible polynomials
wrong_answers:
  - Square matrices
  - Random vectors
  - Cubic roots
explanation: |
  In cryptography, finite fields of order 2^m often use irreducible polynomials to ensure that the field is well-defined and that all operations are possible.
