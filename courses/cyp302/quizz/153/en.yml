question: What security issue arises if the same message is encrypted multiple times in the simplified RSA cryptosystem?
answer: The message will always produce the same encryption
wrong_answers:
  - The message will be vulnerable to brute force attacks
  - The message will be reversed
  - The message will become impossible to decrypt
explanation: |
  In a simplified RSA, encrypting a message multiple times will always produce the same result, making the encryption vulnerable to attacks.
