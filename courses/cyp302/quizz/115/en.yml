question: What does the term "diffusion" mean in the context of AES encryption?
answer: A change in the plaintext results in a significant change in the ciphertext
wrong_answers:
  - The ciphertext is always the same length
  - The key bytes are distributed evenly
  - Sensitive information is scrambled in each block of ciphertext
explanation: |
  Diffusion means that a small change in the plaintext results in a significant change in the ciphertext, making it difficult for an attacker to deduce the plaintext.
