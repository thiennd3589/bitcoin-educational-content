question: What distinguishes a standard-length RC4 key stream from the simplified version presented in the example?
answer: The length of the S array in standard RC4 is 256 bytes
wrong_answers:
  - The S array is limited to 128 bytes
  - The key used must be more than 8 bytes
  - There is no fixed length for S in standard RC4
explanation: |
  In standard RC4, the S array contains 256 bytes, which significantly increases the complexity of the calculations and enhances security compared to the simplified version with only 8 bytes.
