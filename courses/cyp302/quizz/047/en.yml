question: According to Euler's theorem, what is the result of the exponentiation a^ϕ(N) mod N for two integers a and N that are coprime?
answer: 1 mod N
wrong_answers:
  - 0 mod N
  - N mod a
  - a mod N
explanation: |
  Euler's theorem states that for two integers a and N that are coprime, the exponentiation a^ϕ(N) mod N is always equal to 1 mod N, a property used in cryptography.
