question: In the RSA cryptosystem, why is it difficult to find the value of d?
answer: Because it requires knowledge of φ(N), which depends on the prime factors of N
wrong_answers:
  - Because d is a random number
  - Because d is larger than N
  - Because d is calculated independently of φ(N)
explanation: |
  Finding d is difficult because it relies on the knowledge of φ(N), which in turn depends on the values of p and q, the prime factors of N.
