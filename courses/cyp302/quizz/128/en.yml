question: What difficult computational problem is associated with asymmetric systems like RSA?
answer: Prime number factorization
wrong_answers:
  - Exponential multiplication of integers
  - The creation of long random numbers
  - Secure key exchange
explanation: |
  RSA is based on the difficulty of prime number factorization, a computationally difficult task that makes the cryptosystem secure against attacks.
