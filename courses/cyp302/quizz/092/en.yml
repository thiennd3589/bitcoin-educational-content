question: How can a block cipher be transformed into a stream cipher?
answer: By using modes like OFB that generate a key stream from the block cipher
wrong_answers:
  - By dividing the plaintext into bytes and encrypting them one by one
  - By applying padding to messages before encryption
  - By increasing the key length for each encrypted block
explanation: |
  Modes like OFB allow a block cipher to act as a stream cipher by generating a key stream, which is then used for each portion of the plaintext.
