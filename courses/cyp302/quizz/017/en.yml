question: What is the difference between a discrete random variable and a continuous one?
answer: A discrete variable has a finite number of possible outcomes, whereas a continuous variable can take an infinite number of values within an interval.
wrong_answers:
  - A discrete variable constantly changes value, while a continuous variable remains stable.
  - A discrete variable is specific to physical experiments conducted, a continuous variable is abstract in its interval.
  - Discrete variables do not exist in modern cryptography, only continuous variables are used.
explanation: |
  Discrete variables have a finite set of outcomes, while continuous variables can take any value within an interval, such as the real numbers between 0 and 1.
