question: In the context of the RSA cryptosystem, what does the product of two prime numbers p and q correspond to?
answer: It constitutes the integer N used as the modulus for operations
wrong_answers:
  - It constitutes the public key
  - It serves as the decryption key
  - It is used only to generate the exponent e
explanation: |
  In RSA, the integer N is the product of two large prime numbers p and q, and it is used as the modulus for encryption and decryption operations.
