question: Why is asymmetric cryptography less used than symmetric cryptography in large data exchanges?
answer: It is less efficient for an equivalent level of security
wrong_answers:
  - It does not ensure the authenticity of messages
  - It requires multiple public keys for each exchange
  - It is not compatible with modern communication protocols
explanation: |
  Asymmetric cryptography, while powerful for authentication and initial encryption, requires more resources, making its use inefficient for substantial data transfers.
