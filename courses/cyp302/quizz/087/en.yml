question: Which block cipher method uses an initialization vector and creates probabilistic encryption?
answer: CBC ("Cipher Block Chaining")
wrong_answers:
  - ECB ("Electronic Code Book")
  - AES-128
  - SHA-256
explanation: |
  The CBC method uses an initialization vector and applies an XOR between each block of plaintext and the previous encrypted block, making the encryption probabilistic and safer than ECB.
