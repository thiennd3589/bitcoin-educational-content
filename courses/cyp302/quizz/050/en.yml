question: Why are extension fields with a base of 2 useful in cryptography?
answer: They allow for the secure manipulation of binary strings.
wrong_answers:
  - They simplify calculations by reducing the number of operations.
  - They prevent calculation errors by adding redundancy.
  - They limit the range of possibilities by decreasing the number of elements.
explanation: |
  Extension fields with a base of 2 are convenient because their elements can be viewed as binary strings, making it easier to perform operations on digital data at the binary level in systems.
