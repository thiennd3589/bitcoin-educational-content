question: What is a stream cipher in cryptography?
answer: A symmetric encryption that generates a stream of keys the same length as the message
wrong_answers:
  - An asymmetric encryption based on prime numbers
  - An encryption that uses multiple different decryption keys
  - An encryption that segments the message into data blocks
explanation: |
  A stream cipher is a symmetric encryption in which a stream of keys the same length as the message is combined with the latter to produce the encrypted text.
