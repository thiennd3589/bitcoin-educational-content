question: What is the main goal of number theory?
answer: To study the properties of integers and the functions that operate with them
wrong_answers:
  - Analyze geometric transformations
  - Study the structure of random geometric figures in a finite group
  - Develop symmetric encryption algorithms
explanation: |
  Number theory focuses on the properties of integers and the functions applied to integers, often for applications in cryptography, especially in the context of public key cryptography.
