question: What is the main difference between a random string and a pseudorandom string?
answer: A random string comes from a pure random process, while a pseudorandom string is generated by an algorithm from a seed.
wrong_answers:
  - A pseudorandom string uses only 1 bits.
  - A random string is always longer than a pseudorandom string because there is a natural action on it.
  - A pseudorandom string is defined by a strictly binary model, while a random string is defined by a strictly hexadecimal model.
explanation: |
  A random string comes from a direct random process, whereas a pseudorandom string is produced using an expansion algorithm and an initial seed.
