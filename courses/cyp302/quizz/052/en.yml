question: In a finite field, what is the role of an irreducible polynomial?
answer: Define the multiplication operations in the field
wrong_answers:
  - Define the additive inverse of each element
  - Ensure the closure of the field
  - Determine the multiplicative identity
explanation: |
  Irreducible polynomials are used to structure multiplication in finite fields, ensuring that each element remains within the field.
