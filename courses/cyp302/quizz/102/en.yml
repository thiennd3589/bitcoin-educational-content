question: What is the correct order of operations in authenticated encryption?
answer: First encrypt, then create a tag on the encrypted text
wrong_answers:
  - First create a tag, then encrypt the message and the tag
  - Combine the plaintext with a tag, then encrypt
  - Create a tag, then use a public key to encrypt it
explanation: |
  To ensure security, authenticated encryption must first encrypt the message, then generate a tag on the encrypted text. Other orders are potentially vulnerable.
