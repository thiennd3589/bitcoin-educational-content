question: In what case can we say that two events are independent?
answer: The probability of one does not affect the probability of the other
wrong_answers:
  - The two events always occur simultaneously
  - They are mutually exclusive
  - Their combined probability is equal to the highest probability of the two
explanation: |
  Two events are independent if the probability of one does not change the probability of the other, such as a lottery draw having no influence on the weather of the next day.
