answer: Setting up a user interface
wrong_answers:
  - Stating security definitions
  - The mathematical complexity assumptions
  - The mathematical demonstration of security
explanation: |
  The security proof in modern cryptography focuses on objectives and mathematical assumptions, excluding aspects like the user interface, which is not relevant to cryptographic security.
