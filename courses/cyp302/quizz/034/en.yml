question: What is a pseudorandom string?
answer: A string that appears to come from a uniform variable but is produced by an expansion algorithm
wrong_answers:
  - A string generated with an identical probability for each character
  - A fixed-length string from a natural random event
  - A random string chosen only from the binary values 0 and 1
explanation: |
  A pseudorandom string is produced by an expansion algorithm from a smaller seed, in a way that mimics a uniform selection among all strings of the same length.
