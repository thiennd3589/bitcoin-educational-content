question: What is the typical block size for block cipher encryption?
answer: 64, 128, 192, or 256 bits
wrong_answers:
  - 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits
  - 4, 8, 16, or 32 bits
  - 256, 512, 1024, or 2048 bits
explanation: |
  Block ciphers process data in fixed-size blocks, typically 64, 128, 192, or 256 bits, to ensure optimal security and integrity of the encryption.
