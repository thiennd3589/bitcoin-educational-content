question: Why is it difficult to construct a "block mode" encryption from a stream cipher?
answer: Because stream ciphers process data continuously
wrong_answers:
  - Because stream ciphers do not use private keys
  - Because block modes require longer keys
  - Because stream ciphers are always slower
explanation: |
  Stream ciphers are designed to encrypt data continuously (bit by bit or byte by byte), which complicates their use in block mode that requires processing in fixed-size blocks.
