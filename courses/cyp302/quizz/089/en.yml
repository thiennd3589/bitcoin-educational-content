question: What is the importance of using a random nonce in CBC and OFB methods?
answer: It ensures that each encryption session is unique, even for identical data.
wrong_answers:
  - It reduces the key length throughout the encryption process.
  - It makes the encryption faster.
  - It makes the algorithm's code more beautiful for humans.
explanation: |
  By using a random nonce for each session, the CBC and OFB methods ensure that each encryption is unique, which prevents attacks that exploit identical data.
