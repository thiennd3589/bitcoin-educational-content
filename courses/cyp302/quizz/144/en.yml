question: What is the typical size of prime numbers used in factorization for modern cryptosystems like RSA?
answer: 1024 bits for each factor
wrong_answers:
  - 1024 bits in total
  - 256 bits for each factor
  - 256 bits in total
explanation: |
  In modern cryptosystems like RSA, the chosen prime numbers are typically 1024 bits each, making factorization extremely difficult and enhancing security.
