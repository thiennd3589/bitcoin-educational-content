question: What happens if an attacker intercepts an encrypted message in a good symmetric encryption scheme?
answer: They should not learn anything significant about the original message
wrong_answers:
  - They can always decrypt the message without the key
  - They should be able to decrypt it with a public key
  - They should be able to guess the content of the message
explanation: |
  In a well-designed symmetric encryption scheme, an attacker intercepting an encrypted message should not be able to deduce relevant information about the content of the message without the decryption key.
