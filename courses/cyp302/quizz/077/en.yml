question: What is the role of Kerckhoff's principle in cryptography?
answer: To ensure that security relies on the secret key, not on the secrecy of the scheme
wrong_answers:
  - To ensure that security relies on the secrecy of the scheme, not on the secret key
  - To require a very long encryption key
  - To guarantee that each message has a unique key
explanation: |
  According to Kerckhoff's principle, the security of a cryptographic system should rely solely on the secret key, and not on the secrecy of the algorithm itself.
