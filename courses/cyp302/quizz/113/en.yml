question: What is the role of the K array in RC4 encryption?
answer: It initializes and transforms the S array to generate the keystream
wrong_answers:
  - It directly encrypts the plaintext
  - It stores the encrypted text
  - It serves only as temporary storage for data until the end of the process
explanation: |
  The K array is used to transform the S array in the key scheduling process, which allows for the generation of a pseudorandom keystream to encrypt the plaintext.
