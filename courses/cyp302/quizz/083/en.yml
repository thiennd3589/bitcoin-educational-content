question: Why are pseudorandom stream ciphers more commonly used in practice than one-time pads?
answer: They allow the use of a shorter key while generating a longer key stream
wrong_answers:
  - They do not require a secret key
  - They use a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption
  - They do not need key updates
explanation: |
  Pseudorandom stream ciphers are more practical because they allow a short key to be extended into a longer key stream, avoiding the need to store a key as long as the message itself.
