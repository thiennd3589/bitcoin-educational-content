question: Why is authenticated encryption resistant to chosen-ciphertext attacks?
answer: Because any modification of the ciphertext by an attacker renders the tag invalid
wrong_answers:
  - Because it uses a single encryption algorithm
  - Because any modification of the ciphertext by an attacker renders the key invalid
  - Because it encrypts only the message without a tag
explanation: |
  An authenticated encryption scheme is designed to detect modifications of the ciphertext, which renders the tag invalid in case of tampering attempts and ensures resistance to chosen-ciphertext attacks.
