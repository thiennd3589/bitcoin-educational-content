question: What is the main goal of asymmetric cryptography in the context of communication between Alice and Bob?
answer: To allow Bob to transmit a secret message to Alice using her public key
wrong_answers:
  - To allow Bob to encrypt and decrypt messages without a public key
  - To prevent Alice from decrypting Bob's messages
  - To allow Alice to encrypt the message to verify its integrity
explanation: |
  In asymmetric cryptography, Alice's public key enables Bob to send an encrypted message that only she can decrypt, thus ensuring the message's confidentiality.
