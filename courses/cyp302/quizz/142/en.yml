question: What is the name of a problem where it is easy to compute a result in one direction but almost impossible to reverse?
answer: A one-way function
wrong_answers:
  - A linear function
  - An exponential function
  - A reversible function
explanation: |
  One-way functions allow for quick computation in one direction, but make the inverse solving practically impossible, hence their utility in cryptography.
