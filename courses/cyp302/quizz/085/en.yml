question: What is a block cipher in cryptography?
answer: An algorithm that transforms a fixed-length string into another string of the same length
wrong_answers:
  - An asymmetric encryption based on public and private secret keys
  - A system that encrypts variable-length data by stream
  - An encryption that does not require a secret key
explanation: |
  A block cipher is an algorithm that applies a transformation on a fixed-length bit string with a key to produce another string of the same length.
