question: What are the implications of Euler's theorem in the context of asymmetric cryptography?
answer: It simplifies the calculation of powers
wrong_answers:
  - It allows for the direct encryption of messages
  - It is used to find prime numbers
  - It is used to verify the parity of a number
explanation: |
  In asymmetric cryptography, Euler's theorem simplifies the calculation of powers in schemes like RSA, as it provides a method for manipulating modular exponentiations.
