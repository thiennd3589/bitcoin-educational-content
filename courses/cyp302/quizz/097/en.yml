question: Why is confidentiality alone not enough to ensure secure communication?
answer: Because an attacker can still intercept and modify the message without understanding its content.
wrong_answers:
  - Because confidentiality is too difficult to obtain.
  - Because private keys can be easily guessed.
  - Because messages cannot be authenticated without a digital signature.
explanation: |
  Confidentiality protects the content of messages, but without a MAC, an attacker could still intercept and modify a message without understanding it, thus compromising the integrity of the communication.
