question: What is the main source of confusion between the terms block cipher and stream cipher?
answer: Block ciphers are sometimes understood solely as algorithms using block modes like ECB or CBC.
wrong_answers:
  - Stream ciphers are always less secure than block ciphers.
  - Block ciphers operate on one bit at a time.
  - Stream ciphers always require padding.
explanation: |
  The confusion arises from the fact that some consider block ciphers only as algorithms using specific blocking modes, whereas in reality, they can include encryption schemes like the OFB mode.
