question: What are the three essential components of a symmetric encryption scheme?
answer: A key generation algorithm, an encryption algorithm, and a decryption algorithm
wrong_answers:
  - A hashing algorithm, a public key, and a verification algorithm
  - A public key, a private key, and a decryption algorithm
  - An encryption algorithm, a public key, and a private key
explanation: |
  A symmetric encryption scheme consists of three elements: a key generation algorithm, an encryption algorithm, and a decryption algorithm. They all use the same key.
