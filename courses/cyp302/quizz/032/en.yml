question: Why is a pseudorandom string said to be "indistinguishable" from a truly random string?
answer: Because it is almost impossible to determine its origin without additional information
wrong_answers:
  - Because it contains deterministic segments identical to a truly random string
  - Because it uses floating numbers in its construction
  - Because it is generated solely from natural events
explanation: |
  A pseudorandom string is designed to closely resemble a true random string, making the distinction impossible without access to the seed or the algorithm used.
