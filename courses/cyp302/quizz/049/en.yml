question: What type of group is particularly important for public key cryptography due to its ability to generate all elements through exponentiation?
answer: Cyclic groups
wrong_answers:
  - Non-abelian groups
  - Infinite groups
  - Complex number groups
explanation: |
  In cryptography, cyclic groups are essential because they allow for the generation of all the elements of the group by using the exponentiation of a single element, called a generator.
