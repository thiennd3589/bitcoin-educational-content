question: How is the exponent "e" chosen in the RSA cryptosystem?
answer: It must be an integer greater than 2, coprime with φ(N)
wrong_answers:
  - It must be a prime number less than N
  - It is chosen randomly without restriction
  - It must be equal to φ(N)
explanation: |
  In RSA, the exponent "e" is chosen such that it is greater than 2 and coprime with φ(N), which ensures the security of the operations.
