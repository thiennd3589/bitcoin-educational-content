question: Why is the set of integers with addition a group, while it is not with multiplication?
answer: The set does not satisfy the inversion condition under multiplication
wrong_answers:
  - The set is not closed under multiplication
  - Multiplication is not associative over the integers
  - There is no neutral element for multiplication
explanation: |
  The set of integers does not satisfy the inversion condition under multiplication because there is no inverse for each integer that would multiply to give 1. Only the elements 1 and -1 meet this condition.
