question: What mathematical concept underlies the Diffie-Hellman key exchange?
answer: A one-way function with a backdoor
wrong_answers:
  - An inverse exponential function
  - A cryptographic hash algorithm
  - A simplified modular division
explanation: |
  Diffie-Hellman relies on a one-way function that is easy to compute in one direction but practically impossible to reverse without a secret piece of information, called a backdoor.
