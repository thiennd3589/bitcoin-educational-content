question: At which stage of AES encryption are Galois Fields used?
answer: In byte substitution and the MixColumns operation
wrong_answers:
  - In the generation of the private key
  - When dividing the text into 128-bit blocks
  - At every stage of the XOR operation
explanation: |
  Galois Fields are used in byte substitution to calculate the multiplicative inverse and in the MixColumns operation to perform multiplications modulo an irreducible polynomial.
