question: What is the definition of a random variable in the context of cryptography?
answer: A variable that can take several possible values with a positive probability
wrong_answers:
  - A variable that changes value at every moment
  - A variable whose values are fixed and predefined
  - A variable always defined in the context of a specific physical experiment
explanation: |
  A random variable can take two or more values, each with a positive probability, and it is often defined abstractly in the context of cryptography.
