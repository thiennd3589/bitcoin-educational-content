question: What is the role of Bayes' theorem in probability?
answer: It allows for the calculation of conditional probability by reversing the events.
wrong_answers:
  - It provides the probability of occurrence of a single event.
  - It defines the total probability of all possible events.
  - It applies only to continuous variables.
explanation: |
  Bayes' theorem enables the calculation of the probability of an event A given B by reversing the probabilities and is essential in probability theory.
