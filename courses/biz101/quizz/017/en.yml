question: Why might a company consider holding part of its treasury in Bitcoin?
answer: As a potentially appreciating asset that can store value and offer liquidity without relying on traditional financial intermediaries.
wrong_answers:
  - To immediately eliminate all risk and guarantee stable returns.
  - To comply with mandatory government regulations requiring Bitcoin holdings.
  - To ensure it can never convert its assets back into traditional currencies.
explanation: |
  Bitcoin’s scarcity, global liquidity, and independence from traditional banking systems can make it attractive as a treasury asset. Although it involves risk and volatility, businesses may view it as a long-term store of value and a hedge against inflation.
