explanation: |
  The Cantillon Effect, named after 18th-century economist
  Richard Cantillon, describes how the distribution of new
  money in an economy can lead to wealth disparities. Those
  closest to the source of the new money (such as bankers and
  asset owners) benefit first and most significantly, while
  those further away (such as average workers and savers) see
  less benefit or even negative effects due to inflation.
