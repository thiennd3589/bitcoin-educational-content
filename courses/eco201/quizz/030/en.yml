question: What is the implication of the sequential nature of human action on production activities?
answer: Any production detour, i.e., any lengthening of the production structure, requires prior saving.
wrong_answers:
  - The sequential nature of human action has no implication on production activities.
  - The sequential nature of human action implies that production activities must be carried out in a specific order.
  - The sequential nature of human action implies that production activities must be carried out simultaneously.
explanation: |
  Due to the sequential nature of human action, individuals
  must make intertemporal choicesâ€”decisions balancing
  immediate needs with future goals. These choices influence
  the sequence of actions one can take, as short-term
  decisions are subordinate to long-term objectives. In terms
  of production, this means that any detour in the production
  process, i.e. lengthening of the production structure,
  requires prior saving. Resources must be set aside now to
  sustain the individual during the time needed for the
  longer, more productive path.
