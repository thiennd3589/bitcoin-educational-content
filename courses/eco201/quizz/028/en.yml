question: What is the relationship between time preference and interest rates in an economy with unmanipulated capital markets?
answer: An increase in interest rates results from a relative increase in demand for capital compared to supply, indicating higher time preferences. Conversely, a decrease in interest rates occurs due to an increase in savings, which is an increase in the supply of capital, indicating a reduction in time preferences.
wrong_answers:
  - An increase in interest rates indicates a decrease in time preferences, while a decrease in interest rates indicates an increase in time preferences.

  - Time preference and interest rates have no direct relationship.
explanation: |
  In an economy with unmanipulated capital markets, reference
  interest rates are determined at the intersection of
  capital supply and demand. Therefore, these rates represent
  the state of time preferences for the entire economy. An
  increase in the interest rate results from a relative
  increase in demand for capital compared to supply,
  indicating higher time preferences. Conversely, a decrease
  in interest rates occurs due to an increase in savings,
  which is an increase in the supply of capital, indicating a
  reduction in time preferences.
