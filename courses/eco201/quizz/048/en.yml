question: What is the axiomatic-deductive method proposed by Ludwig von Mises in the study of social sciences?
answer: This approach is based on fundamental propositions called axioms, similar to those used in mathematics.
wrong_answers:
  - This approach is based on empirical data and observations.
  - This approach is based on temporary experiments and hypotheses.
  - This approach is based on the positivist approach often used in social sciences.
explanation: |
  Economic experiments cannot be reproduced in a laboratory, and it is important to 
  note that observing a correlation between two variables does not prove a causal 
  relationship between them. This is the reason why Ludwig von Mises proposed the 
  axiomatic-deductive method.
