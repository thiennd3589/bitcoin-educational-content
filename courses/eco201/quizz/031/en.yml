question: What is the role of capital goods in the economy?

wrong_answers:
  - Capital goods are used for consumption.
  - Capital goods have no role in the economy.
  - Capital goods are used to produce other capital goods.
explanation: |
  To produce consumer goods, entrepreneurs combine various
  intermediate goods with original factors of production
  (labor, land, and capital) according to a pattern that
  maximizes the resulting production. All other goods in the
  economy, which we can call intermediate goods, only have
  value because they enable individuals to obtain these
  consumer goods; they are goods used in the production of
  other goods.
