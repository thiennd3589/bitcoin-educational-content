  - ZIRP decreases public debt, encourages lending to entrepreneurs and risk-takers, and discourages government spending.
explanation: |
  Zero Interest Rate Policies (ZIRP) can have several
  unintended consequences. Banks have limited opportunities
  to rebuild their equity because their margins are eroded.
  They also have little incentive to lend, especially to
  entrepreneurs and other risk-takers. Instead, they allocate
  their resources to securitize existing capital or provide
  loans against collateral. Additionally, ZIRP encourages
  governments to engage in extensive spending, leading to a
  significant increase in public debt levels.
