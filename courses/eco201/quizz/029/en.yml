explanation: |
  Time preference is the subjective evaluation of the value
  of future goods compared to present goods. Since we are
  mortal, and the future is always uncertain, we naturally
  prefer to have access to a good now rather than later.
  While time preference can differ between individuals, due
  to a myriad of factors such as culture, wealth, education,
  physiology, etc., time preferences are always positive,
  meaning that all things equal, we always value present
  goods more than future goods.
