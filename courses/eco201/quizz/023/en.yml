question: Why does the problem of coordination in division of labor reemerge in larger communities?
answer: Because humans are limited by their cognitive capacities, and socially accepted measurement of the value of contributions in exchange is a non-trivial problem.
wrong_answers:
  - Because humans are not interested in working with larger groups and prefer smaller communities.
  - Because larger communities have more resources, leading to less need for division of labor.
  - Because larger communities have more conflicts, making coordination difficult.
explanation: |
  In larger communities, it is impossible for a person to
  maintain and remember stable social relationships with more
  than 150 individuals, making a reputation system
  insufficient to overcome the prisoner's dilemma at scale.
  Also, evaluating the value of contributions in exchange is
  a complex problem in larger communities.
