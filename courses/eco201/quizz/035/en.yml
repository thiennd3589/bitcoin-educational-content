explanation: |
  According to the Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle, when there is
  a decrease in interest rates due to an increase in savings, the quantity of final
  goods consumed will decrease as saving involves postponing part of one's consumption
  to a later date. As a result, interest rates will fall because the supply of capital
  is increasing. This allows entrepreneurs to use this influx of capital to create
  new investment goods and thus lengthen the production structure.
