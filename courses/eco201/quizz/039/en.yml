answer: Insufficient aggregate demand
wrong_answers:
  - Overproduction
  - High interest rates

  For both monetarists and Keynesians, the cause of the depression is

  for credit expansion (lowering interest rates) and using the state's 
  deficit capacity to boost demand will kickstart a recovery.
