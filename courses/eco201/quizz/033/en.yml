question: What is the relationship between savings and standard of living according to Austrian economists?
answer: The more we save, the more capital we will be able to accumulate, which will in turn translate into productivity gains yielding more goods. Thus, a higher standard of living is achieved.
wrong_answers:
  - The more we save, the lower our standard of living becomes.
  - There is no relationship between savings and standard of living.
  - The less we save, the higher our standard of living becomes.
explanation: |
  Austrian economists consider that the lowering of time preferences is 
  the starting point for a virtuous cycle of savings → more capital goods 
  → more productivity → more goods = higher standard of living → lower time preference. 
  Thus, the more we save, the more capital we will be able to accumulate, 
  which will in turn translate into productivity gains yielding more goods. 
  This leads to a higher standard of living.
