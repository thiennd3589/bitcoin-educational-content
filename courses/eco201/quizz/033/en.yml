  Austrian economists consider that the lowering of time preferences is\
  \ the starting point for a virtuous cycle of savings \u2013> more capital goods\
  \ \uF0E0 more productivity \uF0E0 more goods = higher standard of living \u2013\
  > lower time preference. Thus, the more we save, the more capital we will be able\
  \ to accumulate, which will in turn translate into productivity gains yielding more\
  \ goods. This leads to a higher standard of living.
