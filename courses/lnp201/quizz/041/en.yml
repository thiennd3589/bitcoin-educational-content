question: Why is it difficult for a transmitting node to estimate the exact liquidity of a channel?
answer: Because only the two participants know the precise distribution of funds
wrong_answers:
  - Because the total capacity of the channels is constantly changing
  - Because the fees of intermediary nodes are not published
  - Because channels automatically close after each transaction
explanation: |
  The precise distribution of funds in a channel is only visible to the two participating nodes, preventing other nodes from estimating the available liquidity for routing.
