question: What is the main goal of HTLCs in the Lightning Network?
answer: To enable secure payment transfers via intermediary nodes without requiring trust in them
wrong_answers:
  - To reduce transaction fees for each payment through intermediary nodes
  - To increase the capacity of each payment channel
  - To establish direct connections between all network nodes with their trust
explanation: |
  HTLCs (Hashed Time-Locked Contracts) ensure that each intermediary node will transfer the payment without keeping the funds, as it can only unlock them by completing the transaction up to the final recipient.
