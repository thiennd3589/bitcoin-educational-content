question: How are key pairs determined in a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet?
answer: All key pairs in the wallet are determined in a deterministic and hierarchical manner from a unique piece of information at the base of the wallet.
wrong_answers:
  - All key pairs in the wallet are determined independently of others, randomly, by a random number generator.
  - Each key pair in the wallet is determined deterministically from the previous key pair.
  - The key pairs are all random and without hierarchical linkage.
explanation: |
  In HD wallets, all keys are derived from a unique piece of information called a "seed," which allows for hierarchical and deterministic management of keys.
