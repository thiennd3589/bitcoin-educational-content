question: Why is it important to use a good source of entropy to generate private keys?
answer: Poor entropy can make private keys predictable and vulnerable to attacks.
wrong_answers:
  - Good entropy helps optimize wallet performance.
  - Entropy plays no role in the security of private keys.
  - Poor entropy slows down transactions.
explanation: |
  If the entropy used to generate private keys is low, it could allow an attacker to guess or compute these keys, compromising the security of the wallet.
