question: What are the characteristics of a cryptographically secure PRNG?
answer: It must be unpredictable, statistically random, and resistant to attacks.
wrong_answers:
  - It must be fast, usable in the cloud, and open source.
  - It must be non-deterministic, based on a physical phenomenon, and scalable.
  - It must be hardware-based, generated by a processor, and reversible.
explanation: |
  A cryptographically secure PRNG must be unpredictable, resistant even if some results are revealed, and have a sufficiently long period to avoid the repetition of sequences.
