question: What does the point V represent in the digital signature process with ECDSA as an example in this chapter?
answer: The point calculated from the nonce v and the generator point G (V = v.G).
wrong_answers:
  - The point derived directly from the public key.
  - The hash of the signed message.
  - The result of adding two points on the elliptic curve.
explanation: |
  V is the result of the calculation of the nonce multiplied by the generator point on the elliptic curve.
