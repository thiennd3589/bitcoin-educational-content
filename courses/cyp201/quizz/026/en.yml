question: Why is it important to never reuse a nonce in the ECDSA algorithm?
answer: Reusing a nonce compromises security and can expose the private key.
wrong_answers:
  - Reusing a nonce slows down performance.
  - Reusing a nonce makes the signatures longer.
  - Reusing a nonce increases the size of the public key.
explanation: |
  Reusing a nonce in ECDSA can allow an attacker to discover the private key, compromising security.
