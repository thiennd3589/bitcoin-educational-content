question: What happens if I use an HD wallet with a passphrase and I lose that passphrase?
answer: My bitcoins are lost forever.
wrong_answers:
  - It's not a problem, I can still access my bitcoins with just my mnemonic phrase.
  - I can reset the passphrase with my private key.
  - I can recover my bitcoins by using a wallet without a passphrase.
explanation: |
  If the passphrase is lost, access to the bitcoins is permanently lost, as it is necessary to derive the private keys.
