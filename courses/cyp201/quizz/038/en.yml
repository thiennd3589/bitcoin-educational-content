question: What is the main difference between a PRNG and a TRNG?
answer: A PRNG is deterministic, while a TRNG produces truly random numbers.
wrong_answers:
  - A TRNG is faster than a PRNG.
  - A TRNG uses a seed, while a PRNG does not use any seed.
  - A PRNG is hardware, while a TRNG is software.
explanation: |
  A TRNG (True Random Number Generator) generates random numbers from a physical random phenomenon, unlike a PRNG which is deterministic.
