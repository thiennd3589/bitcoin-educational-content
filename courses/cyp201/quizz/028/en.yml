question: Why is it impossible to retrieve the private key from a valid digital signature?
answer: The signature is based on irreversible mathematical operations on an elliptic curve.
wrong_answers:
  - The private key is encrypted before use.
  - The seed protects the private key.
  - Hashing messages prevents the private key from being retrieved.
explanation: |
  Operations on elliptic curves are irreversible, ensuring that the private key cannot be deduced from the signature.
