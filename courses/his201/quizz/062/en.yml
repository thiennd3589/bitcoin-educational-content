question: What does estimating the hash rate of a cooperative member through partial proof of work involve?
answer: Retrieving lower-degree work proofs than the network difficulty produced by the hasher
wrong_answers:
  - Retrieving the imprint of a stamp including the first byte of each block hash produced by the hasher
  - Retrieving the hasher's electricity bill every month
  - Retrieving work proofs produced on a network of lower difficulty, like BitDNS
