wrong_answers:
  - The total amount of bitcoins transferred.
  - The number of inputs in a transaction.
  - The entropy related to each input or output.

explanation: |
  The Boltzmann score indicates the conditional probability that a specific input is linked to a given output. It is thus a quantitative measure of the conditional probability that an association between an input and an output in a transaction occurs, established on the ratio of the number of favorable occurrences of this event compared to the total number of possible occurrences, in a set of interpretations.
