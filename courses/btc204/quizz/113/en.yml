question: What element prevents an external observer from differentiating between Stonewall and Stonewall x2 transactions?

answer: The pattern of the transactions is the same

wrong_answers:
  - The transactions are encrypted
  - The amounts involved in the transactions are always identical
  - The digital signatures of the transactions are generated by the same algorithm

explanation: |
  From an external viewpoint, the transaction pattern is exactly the same. Without additional context information, it is therefore impossible to differentiate a Stonewall transaction from a Stonewall x2 transaction, as they adopt the same pattern.
