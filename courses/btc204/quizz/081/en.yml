question: What cryptographic method is used to prevent the coordinator from linking the inputs and outputs in a coinjoin?

  - P2SH addresses.
  - P2TR addresses.

explanation: |
  In so-called "Chaumian" coinjoins, the use of Tor and David Chaum's blind signatures are combined to ensure that the coordinator cannot know which output belongs to which user.
