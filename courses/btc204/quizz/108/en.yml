question: What heuristic analysis of the chain is used by the payjoin transaction to act as a deception for analysis?

answer: The CIOH

wrong_answers:
  - Address reuse
  - Wallet fingerprinting
  - Versioning reuse

explanation: |
  When an analyst examines a payjoin transaction, they are led to believe that all the inputs come from the same person because of the CIOH. However, this perception is incorrect, as the payment recipient also contributes to the inputs alongside the actual payer. Therefore, the chain analysis is diverted towards an interpretation that turns out to be false.
