question: How does the "stem" phase work in the Dandelion protocol?

answer: The transaction is sent through a random path of nodes.

wrong_answers:
  - The transaction is immediately broadcast to all peers of the source node.
  - The transaction is temporarily stored in a central node before being broadcast.
  - The transaction is encrypted incrementally at each step of the broadcast.

explanation: |
  Dandelion first uses a "stem" phase where the transaction is sent through a random path of nodes. The transaction is then broadcast to the entire network in the "fluff" phase.
