question: Why is biometric data considered less secure than the combination of knowledge and possession for 2FA?
answer: Biometric data should remain on the authentication device and not be disclosed online.
wrong_answers:
  - Biometric data is easier to extract even if kept offline on the authentication device.
  - Biometric data is both harder to remember and use when using an authentication device.
  - Biometric data tools are more expensive to implement and therefore not cost effective compared to other solutions.
explanation: |
  Biometric data is less secure because it should remain on
  the authentication device and not be disclosed online. If
  it is disclosed online, it can be stolen and used for
  unauthorized access.
