explanation: |
  Private browsing is a feature that prevents internet
  browsers from storing browsing history, temporary internet
  files, form data, cookies, and user names and passwords.
  However, it does not hide browsing from your internet
  service provider. On the other hand, TOR network offers
  anonymity by masking the user's IP address and allowing
  access to the Darknet.
