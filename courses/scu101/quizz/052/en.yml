question: Why are hardware tokens, such as USB keys or smart cards, considered to offer optimal security for 2FA?
answer: They generate a unique private key for each site and verify the URL before allowing the connection.
wrong_answers:
  - They are physically harder to steal, but if thieves succeed they'll easily extract the secrets from the device.
  - They generate only one password that is going to be used for every site and verify the URL before allowing the connection.
  - They are newer technology and expensive, so they must be better.
explanation: |
  Hardware tokens offer optimal security because they
  generate a unique private key for each site and verify the
  URL before allowing the connection. This makes it much
  harder for a hacker to gain unauthorized access.
