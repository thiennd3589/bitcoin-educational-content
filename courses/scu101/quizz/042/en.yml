answer: They are more resistant to brute force attacks than passwords of the same length containing dictionary words.
wrong_answers:
  - They are easier to remember but slower to type in.
  - They are always secure as they exceed 20 random characters.

  security because they are more resistant to brute force
  attacks, which attempt to guess passwords by trying all
  possible combinations of characters.
