question: When taking self-custody, what is the first thing you should do to minimise the risk of loss? 
answer: Back up your wallet recovery seed phrase 
wrong_answers:
  - Share your private keys with a trusted party
  - Take note of your recovery seed phrase and store it on your computer
  - Disable two-factor authentication (2FA)
explanation: |
  First and foremost, back up your wallet when taking self-custody.
  Hardware wallets come with a recovery seed phrase, a set of words that 
  can be used to recover your private keys in case your device is lost or damaged.
  Create a physical copy, such as a metal [seed plate](https: //coincodex.com/article/23147/best-metal-crypto-wallets-for-seed-phrase-storage/), of this seed phrase and 
  store it in a safe place. It's important to keep this recovery seed phrase secure. 
  NEVER share it with anyone.
