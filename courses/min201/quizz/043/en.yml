question: What is the meaning of the adage "Not your hashrate, not your reward" in the context of Bitcoin mining?
answer: If you do not control the hashrate, you do not control the mining rewards.
wrong_answers:
  - If you do not have a high hashrate, you will not get any rewards.
  - If you do not own Bitcoin, you will not get any rewards.
  - If you do not have a mining machine, you will not get any rewards.
explanation: |
  The adage "Not your hashrate, not your reward" is similar
  to the well-known adage in the world of cryptocurrencies,
  "Not your keys, not your Bitcoins." It means that if you do
  not control the hashrate, you do not control the mining
  rewards. This is because the rewards from mining are
  directly proportional to the hashrate.
