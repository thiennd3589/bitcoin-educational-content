explanation: |
  Difficulty adjustment is a crucial mechanism in the
  operation of the Bitcoin network, ensuring that blocks are
  mined on average every 10 minutes. This adjustment
  mechanism ensures that the mining time for new blocks
  remains constant over time, regardless of the number of
  miners or the overall computing power of the network.
