question: What is the main advantage of ASICs in the context of Bitcoin mining?
answer: They can perform one specific type of calculation very efficiently
wrong_answers:
  - They can perform a multitude of different types of calculations
  - They consume less electricity than CPUs
  - They are cheaper than CPUs
explanation: |
  ASICs are chips, comparable to a CPU chip, however, they
  are developed to perform only one specific type of
  calculation in the most efficient way possible. In the case
  of Bitcoin ASICs, they are designed for the calculation of
  the SHA256 algorithm.
