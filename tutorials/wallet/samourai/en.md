**Samourai Wallet** is a wallet dedicated to privacy. Despite its user-friendly interface, it offers a great deal of flexibility in its use and security.

Being **100% non-custodial**, you will need to **back up** your 12 words and definitely include a **passphrase** that you should not lose.

Once inside the wallet, sending and receiving is done in the traditional way, but with a plethora of privacy tools such as **Ricochet**, **Stonewall**, **Whirlpool**, **JoinMarket**, **PayNyms**, and others.

For explanations on each of these tools, you can refer to the **"Privacy Tools"** section in the tutorial or visit the [**official Samourai Wallet documentation site**](https://docs.samourai.io/)

Creating a passphrase

Create a secure but memorable passphrase. This passphrase will provide additional security to your wallet and is compatible with any wallet that has implemented the widely supported BIP39 specification.

Your passphrase is a required component when restoring by mnemonic (sometimes called Recovery Words) or when pairing to Whirlpool Desktop apps. It is essential you do not lose or forget your passphrase.

> We do not have knowledge of your passphrase, if you forget your passphrase we cannot help you reset it.
> Do not forget your passphrase!

Create a PIN Code

You will now be asked to create and confirm a PIN code between 5 and 8 digits long. The PIN code is used to easily unlock your wallet without needing to enter your passphrase.

If you forget your PIN code you can always access your wallet with your passphrase.

Create a Paper Backup

You have now created a brand new Bitcoin wallet. You will be shown 12 random words. It is crucial that you write down and secure these 12 secret words.

These words when used together with your passphrase can regenerate your entire wallet, balance, and history in any compatible wallet software.

> Paper Backup Worksheet We provide a template for creating your own offline paper backup

> Your secret words must be kept a secret. Anyone who knows your secret words and your passphrase will be able to steal your bitcoin. Never keep your words saved on a computer or the cloud.

Claim your PayNym Bot

A PayNym is a type of stealth address that is unlike normal bitcoin addresses in that it is safe to share publicly without revealing anything about your wallet including balance or transaction history.

After your wallet is successfully created you will be asked to claim a PayNym Bot. This is a visual representation of the SHA-256 hash of your wallet PayNym address.

Once claimed you will be assigned a unique Bot Name that is uploaded to the public directory of PayNym bots, which can be found at https://paynym.is
