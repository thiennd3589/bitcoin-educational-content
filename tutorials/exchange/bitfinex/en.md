Founded in 2012, Bitfinex is one of the earliest bitcoin and altcoin exchange platforms. Initially focused on P2P bitcoin exchanges, the platform quickly expanded its services to include margin trading, P2P financing, derivative trading, and an OTC ("over-the-counter") market for large volume transactions.

Today, Bitfinex is a comprehensive platform, allowing for both simple bitcoin purchases and the use of advanced trading features with risk management tools. It is accessible via a web version, and for simple transactions, an easy-to-use mobile app is also available.

Bitfinex actively supports the development of Bitcoin, investing in technologies like the Lightning Network and promoting peer-to-peer solutions that foster financial freedom.

## How to buy bitcoin on Bitfinex?

To buy bitcoin on Bitfinex, start by [creating an account on the platform](https://www.bitfinex.com/sign-up/). Make sure to use a unique and strong password, meaning as random as possible, including a wide variety of characters and of sufficient length.

To secure your passwords and ensure the use of strong passwords for your online accounts, especially on Bitfinex, I strongly advise using a password manager. Discover our tutorial on Bitwarden to learn how to install and use it daily:

You can then make a deposit using the payment method of your choice and then buy bitcoin.

You can also set up a recurring bitcoin purchase to smooth out your acquisition price over time (*DCA*).

After purchasing your first bitcoins, you have the option to leave them on the platform, but I strongly recommend transferring them to your own self-custody wallet. If you are not yet familiar with how to use a Bitcoin wallet, I invite you to explore [the "Wallet" section on PlanB Network](https://planb.network/tutorials/wallet).

## How to secure your Bitfinex account?

After creating your account, I recommend securing it by adding a second factor of authentication (2FA), either using a physical key or via an authentication app.

If you are not sure how to use these double authentication solutions to secure your online accounts, I recommend consulting our tutorial on the Authy app:

Or, if you prefer to use a physical key, you can check out our tutorial on Yubikey:

## How to use trading features?

Finally, if you want to use the more advanced trading features on Bitfinex, you can set up your own Trade Desk templates:

You can also create sub-accounts to segregate different uses of Bitfinex.
