  At Bitcoin is for Everyone, we firmly believe that bitcoin is not exclusive to the tech-savvy or the financially privileged; it is for every single person who wants to take control of their finances and shape the future of digital commerce. With this vision in mind, we created the conference "Bitcoin is for Everyone" to empower and educate the local community of Portland, Oregon, and make them an integral part of the increasingly prevalent world of bitcoin.
