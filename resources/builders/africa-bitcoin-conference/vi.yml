  We are a collective of Africans from various regions of the continent, united by the belief that Bitcoin makes the world freer. We are working to promote a movement for its adoption across Africa. Faced with a modern world leaning towards more surveillance and totalitarianism, Bitcoin represents for us a crucial tool for preserving our freedoms and privacy. We envision a technological future where, in contrast to the perspectives offered by the GAFAM, everyone has the opportunity to express themselves freely, autonomously, and without censorship in cyberspace. We advocate for the justice, equality, and neutrality that Bitcoin provides to peoples and individuals. Convinced of its indispensable role, we are committed to a future where every citizen of the world enjoys equitable access to a currency immune to any form of manipulation, for the common good.
