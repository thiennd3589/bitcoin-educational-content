  Bitcoin did not appear out of nowhere. For decades prior to Satoshi Nakamoto’s
  invention, a diverse group of computer scientists, privacy activists, and
  heterodox economists tried to create a digital form of money that could operate
  independently of government control. The Genesis Book tells the story of the
  people and projects that inspired the invention of the world’s first successful
  peer-to-peer electronic cash system.
