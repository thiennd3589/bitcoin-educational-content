  For many, there is no American Dream, only a nightmare. Financial stress and debt burdens weigh heavily. The system just feels rigged.

  Amidst this despair, Americans are finding hope in an unlikely place.

  With the help of a new, alternative financial system, they are finding that they can now save for the long term. While some in Washington see a technology to be feared and dismissed, Americans see Bitcoin as an opportunity. For them, Bitcoin is proving a valuable tool for financial freedom and agency.

  Across America, a broad and diverse coalition is forming. They believe Bitcoin unlocks the door to a revitalized American dream. This book is about that dream.
