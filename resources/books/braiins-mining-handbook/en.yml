  The 1st book in the series, the Bitcoin Mining Handbook starts with the basics
  of mining, explaining the incentives of proof of work, some practical tips for
  mining yourself, and clearing up a common misconception by explaining that
  miners are NOT solving complex math problems. Then it dives a little deeper,
  touching on the emergence of custom firmware for miners, the importance of the
  Stratum V2 protocol upgrade, and the business side of the mining industry.
  Finally, the book wraps up with a selection of the finest mining memes of early
  2022.
