  Money is complicated. But it shouldn’t be! In 100 little comics, The Little
  HODLer tells stories of the past, present, and future of money – in pictures
  instead of complex diagrams, and with a friendly face rather than big words. The
  Little HODLer is on a journey to find the best form of money – one he can use
  freely at any time (even on weekends!), one that nobody can take away from him,
  and one that can’t be printed in trillions. And you bet once he finds it, he’s
  going to HODL it really tight!
