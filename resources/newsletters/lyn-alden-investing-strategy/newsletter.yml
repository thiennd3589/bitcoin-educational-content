  This free newsletter provides insight on stocks, bonds, ETFs, digital assets,
  precious metals, and commodities, with a focus on broad investment strategy,
  asset allocation, and updates on changing market conditions.

  Each issue, you’ll get an analysis on current macroeconomic trends and market valuation. And I show a real-money model portfolio that I have specifically for the newsletter.

  All of the information is data-driven, based on fundamental analysis and value investing principles. I apply patience and objectivity to gradually relocate capital from overvalued asset classes to undervalued asset classes, with an emphasis on risk management.

  I generally use a contrarian strategy. When markets are euphoric and overvalued, I’m cautiously re-allocating to safer assets and building downside protection into the portfolio. When markets are frightened and undervalued, I go on a buying spree. With domestic stocks, foreign stocks, individual equity sectors or stocks, REITs, bonds, precious metals, base commodities, digital assets, and other alternatives, we have plenty of asset classes to monitor and rotate into when they are cheap.

  I also monitor the business cycle and recession indicators, to keep readers aware of economic conditions.
