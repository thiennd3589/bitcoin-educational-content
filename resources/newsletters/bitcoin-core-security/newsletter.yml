  Compared to the Bitcoin Core releases newsletter, this source is less common and
  provides insights of security issues at the moment of the public disclosure.
  This newsletter would be effective for those who want to be aware in a more
  detailed way of both solved and potential issues, and especially for all of
  those with no fix available yet. Under this category will probably fit mostly
  bitcoiner workers, developers and IT systemists.
