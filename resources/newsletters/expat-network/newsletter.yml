  Set of hundreds of news regarding multiple aspects of digital nomad life, with
  focus on specific topics valid for few world countries at a time. This source
  provides a good first-hand amount of information on many important aspects from
  all over the world, it becomes a quick way to learn from other's people
  experience to avoid some mistakes. Expert bitcoiner (but also intermediate ones)
  may decide to dig into it to achieve information from common and more exotic
  countries compared to their native ones, whereas it will be for working while
  tourism, longer stays or even resettle. The Expat Network and its newsletter are
  backed by the Expat Network Ltd. company; however we have to state that it is
  not clear how often this newsletter is still maintained, last time recorded
  messagge is on May 2023. Furthermore, some articles are not written from the
  Network itself but are reposted from third-parties, hence some of the articles,
  especially olders ones, are not available anymore.
