  A grassroots Bitcoin education newsletter written by a long-time Bitcoiner (since 2012) who lives entirely on Bitcoin. The author brings a unique perspective shaped by their experience living under communism for 20 years. The newsletter focuses on practical Bitcoin guides, especially for beginners, with content available in 5 languages. It emphasizes sovereignty, freedom, and Bitcoin maximalism, completely avoiding discussion of other cryptocurrencies. What makes it unique is the author's commitment to only recommending thoroughly tested Bitcoin tools and solutions based on personal experience, along with a regular section of "Darth Memes."
