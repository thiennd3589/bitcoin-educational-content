term: MINING

The act of participating in the Bitcoin system's Proof-of-Work (Proof-of-Work). Proof-of-Work is a mechanism to resist Sybil attacks. It is the foundation of the Nakamoto consensus mechanism, which is the principle used to establish agreement on a single version of the distributed ledger among the different nodes of the network.

Specifically, mining is the search for a value that, when passed through a random mathematical function, yields a result lower than a target number. This target of the Proof-of-Work is adjusted every 2016 blocks by the nodes. This is known as difficulty adjustment. The target number is lowered to increase the mining difficulty, or it is raised to decrease the difficulty, depending on the evolution of the computing power deployed by miners during the previous period.

This work performed by miners is rewarded with each valid block found. The winning miner receives a monetary reward, consisting of the block subsidy (creation of new bitcoins ex nihilo), and transaction fees. Today, the difficulty of the Proof-of-Work on Bitcoin is such that mining requires significant computing power to succeed in winning blocks. As a result, it is often necessary to have specialized electronic chips for executing `SHA256d`, known as ASICs, and to participate in mining pools.
