Initially named "Bitcoin Qt," it is the third client in the history of Bitcoin following Bitcoin by Satoshi Nakamoto, and Bitcoind. It was developed from Satoshi's original code and introduced a graphical user interface for the user. Moreover, even today, the graphical interface of Bitcoin Core is called `bitcoin-qt`. It has been packaged with `bitcoind` since version 0.5. Bitcoin Core software serves several purposes. First and foremost, it acts as a full node client.
