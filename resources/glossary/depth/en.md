term: DEPTH
---

In the context of HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) wallets, depth refers to the specific level of a key (public or private), a chain code, an extended key, or an address within the wallet's derivation structure from the master key. Each level of this structure can be seen as a floor in a key tree, where the master key is at the root (depth 0) and the subsequent levels define various attributes such as:
the purpose (depth 1), the type of currency (depth 2), the account (depth 3), the chain type (depth 4), and the index of the specific address (depth 5).

To move from one depth to the next, a derivation process is used from a pair of parent keys to a pair of child keys.
