> â–º *On April 24, 2024, the 2 co-founders of Samourai Wallet were unjustly arrested for merely writing code. I want to express my unwavering support for them. Their commitment to privacy protection and freedom embodies the core values of Bitcoin. These developers have committed no crime; they have simply worked to provide tools that allow everyone to assert their natural rights. Their trial is of paramount importance for both Bitcoin and its ecosystem, and more broadly for freedom in our democracies. To support them in this ordeal, I invite everyone to contribute to their legal defense. Your donations will ensure the best possible defense for these developers who work daily for our freedoms. They will also create a precedent that deters future intimidation against developers, thus preventing a slowdown in technological innovation on Bitcoin and its ecosystem. **To donate: https://p2prights.org/**.*
