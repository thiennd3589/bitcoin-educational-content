term: BATCHED SPENDING
---

Batched spending is a spending technique primarily used by entities with a high volume of transactions, such as exchange platforms, to optimize and reduce transaction costs. By grouping multiple payments intended for different recipients into a single Bitcoin transaction, batched spending allows for less space consumption in blocks, thereby reducing associated fees. Batched spending is characterized by a recognizable pattern during chain analysis. This pattern is evidenced by the use of a few UTXOs as inputs (often only one) and the creation of multiple UTXOs as outputs. The interpretation of this pattern is that we are witnessing batched spending. When encountering this pattern in chain analysis, it can be inferred that the input UTXO comes from a company with significant economic activity and that the output UTXOs will disperse. Some will belong to the company's clients. Others may go towards partner companies. Finally, there will certainly be a change that returns to the issuing company.
