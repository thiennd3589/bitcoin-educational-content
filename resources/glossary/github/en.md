term: GITHUB
---

A platform for managing and hosting source code that facilitates collaboration among developers. As its name suggests, GitHub is built on the Git version control system. This platform allows for tracking code changes, managing versions, and encouraging collaboration through tools like pull requests and issues. GitHub has become an essential tool for developers, especially within the Bitcoin community where the majority of projects, including Bitcoin Core, the main implementation of the protocol, are hosted. In 2018, Microsoft acquired GitHub for 7.5 billion dollars.
