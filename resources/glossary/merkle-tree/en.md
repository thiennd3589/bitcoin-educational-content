term: MERKLE TREE
---

A Merkle Tree is a cryptographic accumulator. It's a method for proving the membership of a given piece of information within a larger set. It is a data structure that facilitates the verification of information in a compact format. In the Bitcoin system, Merkle Trees are used to group and condense the transactions of a block into a single hash, called the Merkle Root (or "*Root Hash*"). Each transaction is hashed, then the adjacent hashes are hashed together hierarchically until the Merkle Root is obtained.

This structure allows for the quick verification of whether a specific transaction is included in a given block without having to analyze all the transactions. For example, if I only have the Merkle Root and I want to verify that `TX 7` is indeed part of the tree, I would only need the following proofs:
* `TX 7`;
* `HASH 8`;
* `HASH 5-6`;
* `HASH 1-2-3-4`.
With these pieces of information, I am able to calculate the intermediate nodes up to the Merkle Root.

Merkle Trees are notably used for light nodes (known as "SPV") that only keep the block headers, but not the transactions. This structure is also found in the UTREEXO protocol, a protocol that allows for the condensing of the UTXO set of nodes, and in the MAST Taproot.

> â–º *The Merkle Tree is named after Ralph Merkle, a cryptographer who designed this structure in 1979. A Merkle Tree can also be called a "hash tree". In French, it is referred to as "Arbre de Merkle" or "arbre de hachage".*
