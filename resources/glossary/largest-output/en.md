term: LARGEST OUTPUT
---

Heuristic for internal chain analysis. When a sufficiently large gap is identified between two transaction outputs in a simple payment model, it can be estimated that the largest output is likely the change. This heuristic of the largest output is probably the most imprecise of all. If identified on its own, it is quite weak. However, this characteristic can be combined with other heuristics to reduce the uncertainty of our interpretation.
