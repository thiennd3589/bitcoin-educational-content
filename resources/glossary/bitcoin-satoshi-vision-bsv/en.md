term: BITCOIN SATOSHI VISION (BSV)
---

Cryptocurrency system resulting from a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which itself is a fork of Bitcoin (BTC). The Bitcoin SV fork occurred on November 15, 2018, at block 556,766 due to disagreements within the Bitcoin Cash community, particularly regarding block size and the supposed vision of Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin. Two factions clashed:
* Supporters of the "Bitcoin Cash ABC" fork, which became Bitcoin Cash (BCH). This group was notably backed by the famous entrepreneur Roger Ver;
* Proponents of the "Bitcoin Cash Satoshi Vision" fork, which led to the creation of Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV). This faction was, among others, supported by Craig Wright.

Bitcoin SV distinguishes itself from Bitcoin Cash, and even more so from Bitcoin, by its significantly higher block size limit. This characteristic aims to align with what its supporters consider to be Satoshi Nakamoto's original vision for Bitcoin.
