bio: |
  My life has developed in two different phases. I spent 25 years as an after-sales manager for international companies such as Mercedes-Benz and Amazon, specialising in after-sales process management.
  In 2018, my life took a decisive turn when I discovered Bitcoin. This discovery, together with meeting Giacomo Zucco, opened the door to a new world of possibilities, which has led me to join the team of Arkadia, a Swiss bitcoin and digital asset advisory firm. I am a passionate investor and personal bitcoin self-custody advisor, committed to continuously navigating and exploring this fascinating universe.
  The experience gained over the years led to the creation of the course 'SCU205 - Mastering Bitcoin Self-custody'.
